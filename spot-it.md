# Math 560 Assessment 1.

This assessment has two main goals.  First to familiarize you with the use of the online homework submission system.  Second to have try your hands at building intuition about projective geometry through a game.  (If you are distance learner please participate through the discussions.)

On GradeScope when you submit the assignment you will be asked to put your solution to each question separately.  This is to make sure we can grade and give you feedback in adequate time.  Failure to do so will mean that I don't count the assignment for full credit.  So please take the time now to make sure you know how to do this.

------

1. Using one of the spot-it games available to you in class or the faculty lounge, complete the entire projective geometry of the game then take a photograph and up load it to grade scope according to the instructions.  You may work in teams.

2. How many points or on a line, does this change?  How many lines go through each point?
